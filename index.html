So! How do you win games?</p>
<p>
Ah! that part, at least, is easy. It's 2016 and statistics have finally conquered football completely. Each match can be totally predicted by the various players on each team and their attributes. The way it works, according to John Gunnarsen, a stats expert, is thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possession is determined by the team whose midfielders have better total midfield stats. If both teams have equal total midfield stats, possession is shared. If one team has 5 or more points than the other, they will DOMINATE the game.</li>
<li>A team with possession advantage will, statistically speaking, generate two regular chances, while their opponents generate one. If a team is DOMINATING, they will generate three regular chances, while their opponent gets nothing.</li>
<li>Due to their roaring supporters, the home team always gets one additional chance.</li>
<li>A chance is scored if the attacking team's total attack skill is higher than their opponent's total defence skill.</li>
<li>One exception: if a team has a player who is a great tackler, he will stop the opponent's first regular chance just as the striker is about to pull the trigger.</li>
<li>Each team also gets, statistically, one free kick per game. However, if a team is DOMINATING, they are likely to get two free kicks while their opponents get none.</li>
<li>A good free kick taker will score every two free kicks (per match). A good free kick taker is defined as a free kick taker whose attack skill is higher than the goalkeeper's goalkeeping skill - or a player who is a trained freekick expert. </li>
<li>Midfielders and attackers who are amazing dribblers will, statistically speaking, generate one additional free kick per match (note that if there are more than one dribbler, maximum two additional free kicks will be generated). Also note that dribbling defenders are frowned upon.</li>
<li>You can also score from corners. If possession is split evenly, each team gets one corner each (statistically speaking). If one team has possession, they will get one additional corner. (DOMINATING doesn't change anything in terms of corners)</li>
<li>If a team has a speedy midfielder or attacker and the other team has no speedy outfield player, the speedy player will generate one additional corner for his team.</li>
<li>A team who has more outfield players who are excellent headers than their opponents, will score, on average (according to statistics), every second corner. A team without excellent headers will helplessly stare at the opponent's keeper calmly collecting the corner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy, right?</p>
<p>You can choose which positions your 5 players should play (maximum one goalkeeper). </p>
<p>Note that you start with low funds, so consider the above information when building your team ...</p><br />
